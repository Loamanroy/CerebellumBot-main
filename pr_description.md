## Summary

Fixed Docker Compose build failures and nginx configuration issues that were preventing the CerebellumBot platform from starting correctly in containerized environment.

## Changes Made

### Docker Configuration Fixes
- **Updated nginx.conf**: Changed frontend upstream from port 3000 to 5173 to match Vite's default port
- **Fixed docker-compose.yml**: Updated frontend port mapping from `3000:3000` to `5173:5173`
- **Added explicit port flag**: Added `--port 5173` to Vite command for consistency

### Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed 502 Bad Gateway errors caused by nginx unable to reach frontend service
- ✅ Resolved port mismatch between nginx upstream configuration and actual Vite server port
- ✅ All 5 services (backend, frontend, nginx, db, redis) now start successfully
- ✅ Frontend accessible at http://localhost/
- ✅ API proxy working correctly at http://localhost/api/

## Testing
- Verified all containers start without errors using `docker-compose up -d`
- Confirmed frontend loads properly through nginx proxy
- Tested API endpoints work through nginx routing
- All services communicate correctly in containerized environment
